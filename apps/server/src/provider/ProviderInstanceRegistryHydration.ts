/**
 * ProviderInstanceRegistryHydration — derive a `ProviderInstanceConfigMap`
 * from `ServerSettings` and keep `ProviderInstanceRegistry` in sync with it.
 *
 * `settings.providerInstances` is the source of truth. Every built-in driver
 * with a default instance also runs at `defaultInstanceIdForDriver(kind)`
 * when that slot has no entry, using the driver's default config, so a fresh
 * install shows its built-in providers without writing settings first.
 *
 * Hot-reload
 * ----------
 * On layer build we:
 *   1. Read the current `ServerSettings` once and use it to seed the
 *      registry's initial state via `ProviderInstanceRegistry.layer`.
 *   2. Fork a daemon fiber (lifetime tied to the layer's scope) that
 *      acquires `ServerSettingsService.subscribeChanges` and calls
 *      `ProviderInstanceRegistryMutator.reconcile` on every emission.
 *
 * Failures inside the watcher are logged and swallowed so a single bad
 * settings emission cannot kill the registry. Unknown drivers and invalid
 * configs already round-trip through the registry's own "unavailable"
 * shadow bucket.
